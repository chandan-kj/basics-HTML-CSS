            <p>

                I want you to know about how exactly do websites work. What does <strong>HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript</strong> do exactly? <br> <br> Now, in order to access a webpage,
                we all know that you need a browser, right? And that can be <strong> Chrome,
                Safari, Firefox,</strong> whatever is your favorite one.
                These are all pieces of software that allow you to look up the IP address of
                your website and be able to receive data that it can render into this beautiful
                websites that we see. <br> <br>
                 Now,the data that you receive from the server usually consists of three types of files; 
                <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>  <br> <br>
                And it's very likely that you would have come across these types of files or
                these words before, because they're so common and there are so integral to how websites work.
                But, what exactly do they do and why are there so many different types of files? Why can't we just have
                one file that's, you know, a website? Well, they actually have very different jobs. <br> <br> The <strong>HTML</strong> HTML code file
                is responsible for the structure of your website. So if a website was a house,
                then the HTML would be the builder who would come in to build the walls.
                Basically they establish the structure of your house,
                & when you write HTML code, you also build up the structure of your website.
                So you could use HTML to add an image or button or text box,
                whatever it is that you need in your website. <br> <br> Now,
                the second type of file are <strong>CSS</strong> files,
                and these files are responsible for styling your website.
                If you were building a house, then this would be the painters and decorators.
                They would be going around painting the walls or adding stylistic flourishes to your place,
                and generally making the place look the way that you want it to.
                & that's exactly what CSS code does as well. When you incorporate CSS,
                it allows you to specify how you want your website to look.
                So you could say that, yes, I have a button that I got from my HTML,
                but that button I want it to be red and I want the text to be white
                and I want the font of the text to be an Arial. That is all done using CSS code. <br> <br>
                Now the final component is the <strong>JavaScript</strong> code.
                And this is the code that allows your website to actually do things or have
                behavior. And if you were building a house,
                you would have the electrician come in,
                who would be able to connect the wires so that your light bulbs actually switch
                on or somebody who comes in and does the plumbing so that your toilet can
                actually flush. And the JavaScript code does exactly that.
                It allows your website to actually do things and have behavior. <br> <br>
                So if we take the Google website as an example again,
                once we receive these files from Google server,
                when our browser loads up the HTML files, we'll get to see the structure
                of the website, namely, there's one image which has their logo,
                there's two buttons, and there's a text box where we can enter our search. Now,
                when we receive the CSS files,
                then that will modify the appearance of all of those components.
                We don't have any more buttons or any more images,
                but the now look the way that Google wanted it to. Finally,
                when we incorporate the JavaScript files,
                then our website actually starts having behavior. It has functionality
                and it's actually able to do something rather than just display some images and
                texts to us.
